**A portable, open-source, low-cost incubation chamber for real-time characterization of soil respiration and microbial activity**

The incubation chamber with low-cost CO2/O2 sensors is used to measure soil respiration during incubation experiements.
To replicate the incubation chamber, please ensure to prepare the full list of hardwares and follow the assembly instruction provided in the file 'Incubation chamber DIY guide.xlsx'. Additionally, you will need to upload the provided code file 'IncubationCellsCO2O2.ino' to run the chamber. Refer to the 'User guide' sheet in the 'Incubation chamber DIY guide.xlsx' for instructions on code upload and chamber testing.

This project is open-source, and modifications and customizations are encouraged if required. However, any changes made to the design or code are at your own risk.
